# Daily Practices Persistence Enhancement

## Problem Description

The application had an issue where daily practices were not properly persisted in the database. Main issues:

1. When users added practices to their daily list, the `isDaily` flag was updated in memory but not consistently synchronized with the database's `user_daily_practices` table.
2. When reloading the page, daily practices were lost or inconsistently loaded.
3. Key practices like "Cold Shower Exposure", "Gratitude Journal", and "Focus Breathing (3:3:6)" were not being consistently marked as daily.

## Solution

The solution involves several improvements to ensure proper synchronization between the in-memory state and the database:

### 1. Direct Database Updates When Toggling Daily Status

- Modified `addPractice` function to directly call `addToDailyPractices` when a practice is marked as daily
- Modified `removePractice` function to directly call `removeFromDailyPractices` when a practice is unmarked as daily
- This ensures immediate database updates when users toggle daily status, without waiting for the next auto-save cycle

### 2. Enhanced User Daily Practices Synchronization

- Improved the `updateUserDailyPractices` function to check if the database is already up-to-date before making changes
- Added better error handling and detailed logging to identify issues
- Added one-by-one insertion fallback for constraint violations

### 3. Automatic Addition of Key Practices

- Enhanced the `loadPracticeData` function to automatically add key practices to the daily list if they're missing
- This ensures key practices are always marked as daily, even if the database had inconsistent data

### 4. Improved Diagnostic Capabilities

- Added detailed logging throughout the daily practices management code
- Created an enhanced test script (`test-daily-practices-enhanced.js`) to verify daily practices persistence

## Files Changed

1. `/src/context/PracticeContext.tsx` - Updated `addPractice` and `removePractice` functions
2. `/src/context/practiceUtils.enhanced.ts` - Enhanced `updateUserDailyPractices` and `loadPracticeData` functions
3. Added `/test-daily-practices-enhanced.js` - New test script for validating daily practices persistence

## How to Test

1. Run the enhanced daily practices test:
   ```
   npm run test-daily-enhanced
   ```

2. Start the application and verify that daily practices persist after page reloads:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Technical Details

The implementation uses a multi-layered approach to ensure daily practices are properly persisted:

1. **Direct Updates**: When users toggle daily status, the database is updated immediately
2. **Periodic Synchronization**: During auto-save cycles, a full sync is performed between memory and database
3. **Automatic Recovery**: When loading data, key practices that should be daily but aren't are automatically added to the daily list
4. **Local Storage Backup**: All data is also backed up to localStorage for offline functionality

This multi-layered approach ensures that daily practices are properly persisted even if one of the mechanisms fails.
