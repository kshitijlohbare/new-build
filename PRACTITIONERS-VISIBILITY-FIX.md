# Practitioner Visibility Fix Documentation

## Issue Status: RESOLVED âœ…

Our investigation confirmed that practitioners are currently visible to anonymous users. The Row-Level Security (RLS) configuration appears to be working correctly.

## Problem Description
We investigated a concern about the practitioners table in the database potentially having a Row-Level Security (RLS) configuration issue that would prevent anonymous users from viewing practitioner data. This would have been a critical problem as anonymous users need to be able to browse practitioners before signing up or logging in.

## Investigation Results

Our comprehensive verification shows:

1. **Accessibility Test**: Anonymous users can successfully access practitioner data.
2. **Data Verification**: We confirmed the presence of 5+ practitioners in the database.
3. **Sample Data**: Practitioners like Dr. Sarah Johnson, Dr. Michael Chen, and others are properly visible.

## Implementation

We created several scripts to investigate and fix the issue if needed:

1. **Diagnosis Tools**:
   - `check_rls.js`: Checks RLS configuration on practitioners table
   - `verify-practitioners-access.js`: Verifies anonymous access to practitioners
   - `final-practitioners-check.js`: Simple final verification script

2. **Fix Scripts (Created But Not Needed)**:
   - `fix-practitioners-visibility.js`: Complete JavaScript solution
   - `fix-rls-policies.sql`: SQL-only solution for direct database fixes
   - `execute-practitioner-fix.js`: Master script that attempts both approaches

## API Key Observation

We noticed inconsistencies in the API keys used across different files:
- Some files use a key with `svnczxevigicuskpiyfz` in the ref claim
- The production code uses a key with `svnczxevigicuskppyfz` in the ref claim

We standardized all scripts to use the production API key.

## Verification

To verify the current state:
1. Run `node final-practitioners-check.js`
2. The script confirms that practitioners are visible to anonymous users

## Manual Testing
You can also manually test the current state:
1. Try accessing `/practitioners` endpoint in the application
2. Verify that practitioner data loads for anonymous users
3. Check the console for any RLS-related errors

## Best Practices for the Future
1. Always add proper RLS policies when creating new tables
2. Test anonymous access for public-facing data
3. Include RLS policy setup in the initial database setup scripts
4. Maintain consistent API keys across all development files

## Troubleshooting
If issues arise in the future:
1. Use the provided scripts to diagnose the problem
2. Check if the `pg_exec` function exists in the database
3. Verify that the API key has sufficient permissions
4. Run `node final-practitioners-check.js` for a quick verification
