## Technology Used

- Supabase for data storage
- CSS variables for theming

## Future Improvements

1. Add analytics tracking for form completion rates
2. Implement auto-save functionality for long forms
3. Add ability to import credentials from LinkedIn or other professional sites
4. Create a preview mode for practitioners to see how their profile appears to clients
