# User-Specific Daily Practices Implementation Complete

## What Has Been Done

1. **Row Level Security Implementation**
   - Created `enable-practices-rls.sql` with policies to ensure each user can only access their own data
   - Created an application script `apply-rls-fixed.js` to apply these policies to the database
   - Added verification tools to ensure RLS is correctly functioning

2. **Practice Completion Tracking**
   - Added completion tracking columns to `user_daily_practices`:
     - `completed` (boolean)
     - `completed_at` (timestamp)
     - `streak` (integer) 
   - Created a database trigger to automatically update timestamps when practices are completed

3. **Documentation**
   - Created `USER-SPECIFIC-PRACTICES-GUIDE.md` with implementation details and verification steps
   - Added verification script `verify-user-practices-rls.js` to test RLS functionality

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - All database operations now properly filter by user ID
   - Practice data is isolated between users
   - System practices remain visible to all users

## How to Apply These Changes

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Log in to the Supabase Dashboard
2. Access your project's SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `enable-practices-rls.sql`
4. Run the SQL commands

### Option 2: Using the Script

1. Update the `.env` file with your Supabase URL and service key
2. Run `npm install dotenv @supabase/supabase-js`
3. Run `node apply-rls-fixed.js`

## How to Verify Implementation

Run the verification script:
```
node verify-user-practices-rls.js
```

Or test manually by:
1. Logging in as different users
2. Adding practices to each user's daily list
3. Confirming that users only see their own practices

## Next Steps

You now have a secure, user-specific daily practices system. You can further extend it by:

1. Adding shared practice functionality (with explicit user permissions)
2. Implementing practice recommendations
3. Adding statistics on practice completion across users (anonymized)

All the core functionality for user-specific daily practices is now implemented and ready to use!
