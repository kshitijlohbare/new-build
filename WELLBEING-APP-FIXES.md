# Wellbeing App Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address several issues in the wellbeing app.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Practices Not Being Saved After Refresh
- **Problem**: Added practices were lost when the page was refreshed
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved the user_daily_practices junction table synchronization
  - Added explicit boolean conversions for isDaily flag to ensure proper database persistence
  - Enhanced error handling in the database operations
  - Created a fix script to ensure practices are correctly stored in the database

### 2. Incorrect Default Completion Status
- **Problem**: Some practices were incorrectly marked as complete by default
- **Solution**:
  - Created fix-practice-completion.js script to reset all system practices to completed=false
  - Updated PracticeContext to ensure new practices always start with completed=false
  - Added explicit boolean handling for the completed flag

### 3. User-Specific Points, Levels, and Badges
- **Problem**: Points, levels, and badges were not properly tied to each user
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced the UserProgress interface to include userId field
  - Modified the loading logic to ensure user-specific data is loaded
  - Added user context to all saved data

### 4. Multiple Achievement Badge Popups
- **Problem**: Achievement badges were popping up multiple times
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced AchievementContext to use localStorage to track seen achievements per user
  - Implemented proper persistence of previousAchievements to prevent duplicate popups
  - Added user ID to achievement tracking for proper user association

### 5. Badge Carousel on Practices Page
- **Problem**: Achievement badges needed to be displayed on the practices page
- **Solution**:
  - Created a new BadgeCarousel component with animation and navigation
  - Added the component to the Practices page under the progress chart
  - Implemented the getAllUserAchievements function to expose user achievements

## Additional Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: Added improved error handling throughout the codebase to provide better debugging information

2. **Data Synchronization**: Implemented better synchronization between local state and database to prevent data loss

3. **Boolean Handling**: Added explicit boolean conversions to fix issues with isDaily and completed flags

4. **User-Specific Storage**: Enhanced local storage to be user-specific for better isolation between users

## How to Run the Fixes

The fix scripts can be run using:

```bash
node run-all-fixes.js
```

This will execute all required fixes to address database and persistence issues.
