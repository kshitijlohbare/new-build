# Keyboard-Aware Input Implementation Status

This document summarizes the implementation status of keyboard-aware input components across various pages in the application. These components automatically adjust their position when the mobile on-screen keyboard appears.

## Implemented Pages

The following pages now have keyboard-aware inputs and textareas:

1. **GroupMessages**
   - Message input field updated to use `KeyboardAwareInput`

2. **FitnessGroups**
   - Search activity input
   - Form inputs in the "Create New Group" modal
   - Hidden filter inputs

3. **GroupFeed**
   - Post creation textarea
   - Link input field

4. **Learn**
   - Concept search input field

5. **MobileHome**
   - Delight input field

6. **PractitionerOnboarding**
   - Selected sample fields updated: name input, bio textarea
   - Other form fields will need to be updated similarly

7. **TherapyBooking**
   - Search query inputs
   - Location query input

## Components Used

- `KeyboardAwareInput` - A wrapper for standard HTML input elements
- `KeyboardAwareTextarea` - A wrapper for standard HTML textarea elements

## How It Works

The components use the Visual Viewport API to detect when the mobile keyboard appears and adjust their position accordingly. This is handled by the `useVisualViewport` hook which tracks viewport changes.

## Additional Pages to Consider

The following pages have forms or input fields that might benefit from keyboard-aware components:

1. Authentication pages (login, signup, password reset)
2. User profile editing forms
3. Comment/review forms
4. Search forms on other pages

## Deployment Note

As requested, these changes have been implemented but are not yet deployed to production. After testing and validation, they can be deployed in a future release.
