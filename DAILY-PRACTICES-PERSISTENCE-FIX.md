# Daily Practices Persistence Fix

## Issue Overview
Practices added to "daily practices" were not getting saved persistently. This could be due to:

1. Database connectivity issues
2. Table permission problems
3. Race conditions in the saving logic
4. Inconsistent boolean handling (null/undefined vs false)

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a comprehensive fix with multiple layers of redundancy:

1. **Enhanced Database Persistence**
   - Added incremental update approach (add/remove only changed practices)
   - Added full replacement fallback if incremental updates fail
   - Implemented table existence verification and creation
   - Added individual practice insertion fallback if batch insert fails

2. **Explicit Boolean Handling**
   - Ensuring `isDaily` property is always explicitly a boolean value
   - Fixed potential type issues in filter conditions

3. **Local Storage Redundancy**
   - Added backup storage in localStorage
   - Implemented automatic recovery if database operations fail

4. **Better Debug Logging**
   - Added more comprehensive logging with practice IDs and names
   - Can be configured with DEBUG_LEVEL settings

## Files Modified

- `src/context/PracticeContext.tsx` - Updated to use enhanced persistence
- `src/context/practiceUtils.persistence-fix.ts` (New) - Enhanced persistence functions

## Testing & Verification

To verify the fix:
1. Try adding a practice to daily practices
2. Reload the page and confirm it remains in daily practices
3. Try removing a practice from daily practices
4. Reload again to confirm changes persisted
5. Open browser console to see the debug logs

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for any error messages
2. Look for "[DAILY PRACTICES]" prefixed logs
3. Verify database connectivity in Network tab

## Implementation Details

The fix addresses several key issues:

1. **Race Conditions**: Before our fix, there were potential race conditions between state updates and database operations. We now ensure database operations complete before considering the operation successful.

2. **Error Recovery**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure data persists even if primary approaches fail.

3. **Type Safety**: We explicitly handle boolean values to prevent issues with undefined/null values being interpreted as false.

4. **Redundancy**: By implementing both incremental update and full replacement approaches, we increase the likelihood of successful persistence.

## Further Improvements

1. Consider implementing an offline queue for operations when connectivity is lost
2. Add monitoring for persistence failures to detect systematic issues
3. Add automated recovery and retry mechanisms
