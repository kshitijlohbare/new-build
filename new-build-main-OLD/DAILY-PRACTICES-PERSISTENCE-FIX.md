# Daily Practices Persistence Issue Fix

## Problem Summary

Users were experiencing issues where practices that were deleted from the daily practices list would still reappear. This was happening because:

1. There was a synchronization issue between the UI state (practices with `isDaily` flags) and the database junction table `user_daily_practices`
2. The `removePractice` function wasn't ensuring that all persistence layers were updated consistently
3. There was no automatic synchronization trigger to keep these data sources in sync

## Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

### 1. Enhanced `removePractice` Function 

The `removePractice` function in `PracticeContext.tsx` was improved to:
- Set the `isDaily` flag to explicitly `false` (not `undefined` or `null`) when removing a practice
- Ensure both the local state and database are updated consistently
- Immediately call `removeFromDailyPractices` to update the junction table
- Add detailed logging to help diagnose issues

### 2. Database Synchronization Script 

We created `fix-daily-practices-sync.js` which:
- Creates a database trigger to automatically keep the `user_daily_practices` table in sync with the `isDaily` flag in the practices
- Performs a one-time sync for all users to ensure database consistency
- Fixes any existing discrepancies between the two data sources

### 3. User-Accessible Cleanup Tool

We provided `REMOVE-DELETED-DAILY-PRACTICES.md` which contains:
- A script that users can run in the browser console
- Instructions for using the script
- Explanations of what the script does
- Next steps if issues persist

## Testing the Fix

The fix has been tested by:
1. Checking that practices marked as daily appear in the daily practices list
2. Verifying that practices removed from daily no longer appear after refresh
3. Ensuring that the `user_daily_practices` table stays in sync with the practice data

## Future Improvements

For long-term stability, we recommend:

1. Adding a periodic sync check on app startup to verify consistency
2. Implementing a client-side cache invalidation mechanism when practices are modified
3. Creating an admin tool to help diagnose and fix user-specific daily practice issues

## How to Verify the Fix

Users can verify that the issue is resolved by:
1. Making sure all daily practices they expect are visible
2. Removing a practice from daily and refreshing the page - it should stay removed
3. If issues persist, running the cleanup script provided in `REMOVE-DELETED-DAILY-PRACTICES.md`
