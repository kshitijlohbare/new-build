# Database and Code Issue Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Syntax Error in ProfileContext.tsx
- **Issue**: The `getFollowers` function had a duplicate implementation, causing a syntax error at line 305
- **Fix**: Properly removed the duplicate implementation, keeping only the working version that uses the correct two-step query pattern
- **Impact**: The application can now compile and run without syntax errors

### 2. Query Pattern Issues in practiceUtils.enhanced.ts
- **Issue**: The table check was using `.select('count(*)')` which causes parsing errors with Supabase
- **Fix**: Changed to use `.select('id')` which avoids the parsing error
- **Impact**: Table existence checks now work correctly without triggering parsing errors

### 3. Foreign Key Relationship Issues
- **Issue**: The relationships between `user_followers` and `user_profiles` tables were not properly defined
- **Fix**: Added proper foreign key constraints and ensured UUID data types were consistent
- **Impact**: User relationships (followers/following) functionality now works correctly

## Database Schema
All required tables are now properly created and linked:
1. `practices` - System-defined wellbeing practices
2. `user_practices` - User-specific practice data (JSONB)
3. `user_daily_practices` - Junction table for daily practices
4. `user_profiles` - User profile information
5. `user_followers` - Social follow relationships
6. `community_delights` - Community content

## Query Best Practices
The codebase now follows these best practices for Supabase queries:

1. **Avoid direct aggregate functions** (use `.select('id')` instead of `.select('count(*)')`)
2. **Use two-step approach for relationships** (separate queries for related tables)
3. **Ensure proper foreign key constraints** are in place

## Documentation Updates
- Updated `DAILY-PRACTICES-GUIDE.md` with query best practices
- Created `DATABASE-FIXES-SUMMARY.md` with detailed explanation of database structure

## Additional Improvements
- Added proper error handling throughout the database interaction code
- Ensured all tables have proper indexes for better performance
- Fixed trigger functions for automatic timestamp updates

## Next Steps
The application should now run without errors. If any additional issues occur, consider:
1. Reviewing browser console logs for additional errors
2. Checking table permissions in Supabase dashboard
3. Verifying that all required data exists in the database
