# Daily Practices Persistence Fix

## Problem Description

The application had an issue where daily practices were not persisting between page reloads. Key symptoms:

1. When reloading the page, all previously added daily practices disappeared
2. Console logs showed key practices were marked with `isDaily=false` when they should be `true`
3. Database tables (`user_practices`, `practices`, `user_daily_practices`) were returning 404 errors

## Solution

The solution consisted of several parts:

### 1. Database Table Setup

- Created the necessary database tables in Supabase using the SQL schema from `wellbeing_tables_setup.sql`
- Added easy-to-run setup scripts (`npm run setup-db`)

### 2. Daily Practice Flag Persistence

- Fixed the `isDaily` flag setting to ensure it's properly set as a boolean value
- Enhanced the default system practices to be marked as daily by default
- Improved error handling in database functions to allow the app to work even with database errors

### 3. Debugging & Logging

- Added detailed logging to track daily practices status throughout the save/load process
- Created a test script to verify daily practices are persisting correctly (`npm run test-daily`)

## Key Files Modified

1. `/src/context/PracticeContext.tsx`
   - Updated initial practices to properly set `isDaily` and `isSystemPractice` flags
   - Enhanced the `addPractice` function to explicitly handle boolean flags

2. `/src/context/practiceUtils.enhanced.ts`
   - Improved error handling for database operations
   - Enhanced logging for daily practices
   - Fixed the `updateUserDailyPractices` function to better handle database errors
   - Added proper table existence checking

3. New Scripts
   - `create-tables.js` - Sets up the required database tables
   - `test-daily-practices.js` - Tests daily practices persistence

## Usage

1. Set up the database:
   ```
   npm run setup-db
   ```

2. Test daily practices:
   ```
   npm run test-daily
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## How It Works

The application now properly marks practices as daily by:
1. Setting `isDaily: true` on key system practices by default
2. Ensuring the `isDaily` flag is explicitly stored as a boolean value
3. Correctly persisting this flag to the Supabase database
4. Properly loading and restoring the daily practice status on page reload

Additionally, error handling has been improved to allow the app to function even when database operations fail, with detailed logging to aid in debugging.
