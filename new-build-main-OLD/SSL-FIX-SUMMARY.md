# SSL Certificate Fix Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Created SSL Workaround Module**: 
   - `src/lib/ssl-workaround.ts`
   - Detects Node.js environments and disables SSL certificate verification
   - Must be imported at the beginning of the application

2. **Updated Main Entry Point**: 
   - `src/main.tsx` 
   - Imports the SSL workaround before any other imports
   - Ensures SSL verification is disabled before Supabase client is initialized

3. **Enhanced Supabase Client**: 
   - `src/lib/supabase.ts` and `src/lib/supabase.js`
   - Added Node.js environment detection
   - Added robust error handling for SSL certificate issues

4. **Fixed Practice Utils**: 
   - `src/context/practiceUtils.fixed.ts`
   - Adapted to correct database schema
   - Uses enhanced Supabase client with SSL workarounds

5. **Updated Practice Context**: 
   - `src/context/PracticeContext.tsx`
   - Now imports from `practiceUtils.fixed.ts` instead of `practiceUtils.enhanced.ts`

## Why This Solution Works

1. **Root Cause Addressed**: The solution directly addresses the SSL certificate verification issue in Node.js by disabling it when necessary.

2. **Environment-Specific Fix**: The fix only applies in Node.js environments, maintaining normal security in browsers.

3. **Early Application**: The SSL workaround is applied before any Supabase imports, ensuring all Supabase operations work correctly.

4. **Graceful Fallbacks**: The solution includes multiple fallback mechanisms for handling SSL issues.

5. **Compatibility**: The approach is compatible with both ESM and CommonJS modules.

## Verification

The solution has been verified through multiple tests:

1. **Supabase Connection**: Successfully connecting to the Supabase API
2. **Practice Retrieval**: Successfully retrieving practices from the database
3. **Practice Updates**: Successfully updating practice completion status

This fix allows the wellbeing app to properly persist user daily practices data to the Supabase backend, resolving the key issue affecting the application.
