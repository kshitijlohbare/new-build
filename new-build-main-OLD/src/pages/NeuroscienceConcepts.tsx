  {
    term: "Neuroplasticity",
    story: "After suffering a stroke that affected his speech center, Marcus committed to daily speech therapy exercises. Over months, his brain formed new neural pathways, allowing him to regain most of his speech abilities.",
    explanation: "Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life, allowing neurons to adjust their activities in response to new situations or changes in their environment.",

  {
    term: "Default Mode Network (DMN)",
    story: "While sitting quietly on a park bench, Emma's mind wandered through past memories and future plans. The moment she needed to check the time, her brain immediately shifted from this daydreaming state to focused attention.",
    explanation: "The Default Mode Network is a set of brain regions active when a person is not focused on the outside world. It's associated with daydreaming, self-reflection, and mental time travel to past or future.",

  },
  {
    term: "Hebbian Learning",
    story: "After repeatedly practicing piano scales together with his metronome, David's fingers eventually moved in perfect rhythm even when the metronome was off - the neural connections for timing and finger movement had strengthened together.",
    explanation: "Hebbian learning is summarized as 'neurons that fire together, wire together.' When two neurons repeatedly activate simultaneously, their connection strengthens, forming the basis of learning and memory formation.",

  },
  {
    term: "Pruning",
    story: "As toddler Lily grew, she initially babbled in sounds from many languages. After continued exposure only to English, her brain gradually pruned away neural pathways for sounds not used in English, making it harder to produce certain foreign language sounds later in life.",
    explanation: "Synaptic pruning is the process where excess synapses are eliminated to increase the efficiency of neuronal transmissions. This is especially active during development and is critical for learning efficiency.",
    category: "Neuroscience",
    icon: "neuroscience",
  },
  {
    term: "BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)",
    story: "Sarah noticed that on days she exercised before studying, she learned new concepts more quickly and remembered them better. The physical activity increased BDNF production in her brain, enhancing her learning capacity.",
    explanation: "BDNF is a protein that promotes the survival of neurons and encourages the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses. Exercise, fasting, and learning increase BDNF production.",

  {
    term: "Mirror Neurons",
    story: "While watching a basketball player execute a perfect free throw, Miguel's brain activated many of the same motor neurons that would fire if he were taking the shot himself, helping him learn the technique through observation.",
    explanation: "Mirror neurons fire both when an animal performs an action and when it observes the same action performed by another. They're fundamental to learning, empathy, and understanding others' intentions.",
    category: "Neuroscience",
    icon: "neuroscience",
  },
  {
    term: "Neurogenesis",
    story: "Adopting a lifestyle with regular exercise, complex problem-solving, and reduced stress, Hannah fostered the creation of new neurons in her hippocampus well into her 60s, supporting her exceptional memory compared to sedentary peers.",
    explanation: "Neurogenesis is the process by which new neurons are formed in the brain. Contrary to earlier beliefs, research has shown that certain areas of the brain continue to create new neurons throughout life.",

  {
    term: "Stress Response Cycle",
    story: "After a tense meeting, Carlos went for a run to metabolize the stress hormones his body had produced. Without this physical release, those chemicals would have remained in his system, potentially causing long-term health issues.",
    explanation: "The stress response cycle begins when the brain perceives a threat and ends when the body completes actions that signal safety. Physical activity often helps complete this cycle, even when the stressor is psychological.",
    category: "Neuroscience",
    icon: "neuroscience",
  },
  {
    term: "Vagus Nerve Regulation",
    story: "During moments of anxiety, Elena practiced slow, deep breathing exercises that stimulated her vagus nerve, quickly shifting her nervous system from fight-or-flight to a calmer state.",
    explanation: "The vagus nerve connects the brain to many important organs, and its tone (health and function) influences emotional regulation, social connection, and stress resilience. It can be strengthened through breathing, cold exposure, and meditation.",
    category: "Neuroscience",
    icon: "mindfulness",
  },
  {
    term: "Prefrontal Cortex Development",
    story: "Though academically brilliant, 17-year-old Alex still made impulsive decisions around friends. His parents understood this reflected his still-developing prefrontal cortex rather than poor character.",
    explanation: "The prefrontal cortex, responsible for decision-making, impulse control, and planning, isn't fully developed until the mid-20s. This explains why adolescents can be knowledgeable yet still struggle with judgment in emotional situations.",
