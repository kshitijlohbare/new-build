# Empty Daily Practices for New Users

## Problem Solved
This implementation ensures that for new users, the 'Daily Practices' section starts completely empty. Previously, certain default practices ("Cold Shower Exposure", "Gratitude Journal", and "Focus Breathing (3:3:6)") were automatically set as daily practices for new users. Now, all practices (including these key ones) will only be added to a user's daily practices when the user explicitly adds them from the practices page.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Code Changes
- Modified `INITIAL_PRACTICE_DATA` in `PracticeContext.tsx` to set `isDaily: false` for all practices
- Updated the default practice initialization for new users to ensure all practices start with `isDaily: false`
- Removed the auto-addition of key practices to daily practices in `practiceUtils.enhanced.ts`
- Eliminated special treatment of key practices in the `addPractice` function
- Updated the system practice formatting to only mark practices as daily if they're explicitly in the daily practices table

### 2. Database Updates 
- Created a script (`fix-default-daily-practices.js`) to ensure no practices have `is_daily=true` in the database
- Added explicit `is_daily` column check and update to ensure all practices default to `false`
- Added verification script to test that new users start with empty daily practices

### 3. Verification
- Created comprehensive verification script (`verify-empty-daily-practices.js`)
- Tested with new user creation simulation 
- Verified no auto-addition of daily practices is occurring

## How to Test This Implementation

1. Run the database fix script to ensure no practices are marked as daily by default:
   ```bash
   npm run fix-daily-defaults
   ```

2. Run the verification script to test that new users start with empty daily practices:
   ```bash
   npm run verify-empty-daily
   ```

3. Manual verification:
   - Create a new user account
   - Check that the 'Daily Practices' section is empty
   - Add a practice to daily practices
   - Verify it appears in the 'Daily Practices' section
   - Refresh the page and confirm it persists
   - Remove it from daily practices
   - Verify it no longer appears in the 'Daily Practices' section

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Structure
- `practices` table: No practices should have `is_daily=true` by default
- `user_daily_practices` table: Junction table that explicitly tracks which practices are daily for each user
- `user_practices` table: Contains a `daily_practices` array field as a backup/cache

### Loading Flow
1. Application loads user data
2. Checks user's daily practices from junction table
3. Only practices explicitly added by the user are marked as daily
4. No automatic addition of "key practices" to daily list
