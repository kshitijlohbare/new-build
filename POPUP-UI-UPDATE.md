# Popup UI Update

## Changes Made
- Moved the "Close" and "Add to Daily Practices"/"Remove from Daily Practices" buttons to the header section of the popup
- Simplified the button design to fit in the header while maintaining clear functionality
- Removed the footer section of the popup, making the entire UI more compact and focused
- Updated CSS to ensure proper z-index and pointer-events for the new header button layout
- Enhanced mobile view with larger touch targets for the header buttons

## Benefits
1. **Improved Accessibility**: Key actions are now more prominently displayed at the top
2. **Space Efficiency**: Removed redundant footer section, making the popup more compact
3. **Visual Consistency**: Header now contains all main actions related to the popup
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Buttons are easier to reach with thumbs at the top of the display

## Technical Implementation
- Updated `SimplePracticePopup.tsx` to relocate buttons to the header
- Modified `popupFix.css` to ensure proper click/tap handling for the new header layout
- Ensured responsive design with special attention to mobile devices

## Testing Notes
- Verify that both "Close" and "Add/Remove from Daily Practices" buttons work correctly in the header
- Test on touch devices to ensure adequate tap target sizes
- Confirm no regression in popup interaction behavior
