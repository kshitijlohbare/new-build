# Daily Practices Persistence Implementation

This implementation ensures that user practices marked as "daily" are correctly persisted in the database and loaded reliably across page reloads.

## üîë Key Improvements Made

1. **Database-First Approach**
   - Direct database operations when toggling daily status instead of waiting for periodic saves
   - Optimized `updateUserDailyPractices` function to minimize database operations

2. **Strict Type Handling**
   - Explicit boolean comparisons (`=== true`) throughout the codebase
   - Proper type definitions for database responses

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Graceful fallbacks when database operations fail
   - Detailed logging for troubleshooting
   - Multi-level persistence (database + localStorage)

4. **Better UI Feedback**
   - Status indicators when adding/removing daily practices
   - Clear toast notifications
   - Consistent visual indicators of daily status

5. **Testing & Verification**
   - Comprehensive test scripts to verify persistence
   - Verification of key practices' daily status

## üìÇ Key Files Modified

1. `/src/context/practiceUtils.enhanced.ts`
   - Enhanced `updateUserDailyPractices` to efficiently handle changes
   - Improved `addToDailyPractices` and `removeFromDailyPractices` functions
   - Better type handling and error management

2. `/src/context/PracticeContext.tsx`
   - Direct database operations in `addPractice` and `removePractice` functions
   - Explicit boolean handling for `isDaily` flag

3. `/src/components/wellbeing/DailyPracticesSimple.tsx`
   - Added status indicators for operations
   - Improved filtering of daily practices

4. `/src/components/wellbeing/DailyPracticeStatusIndicator.tsx`
   - New component for visual feedback during operations

## üß™ Testing Approach

1. **Automated Tests**
   - `test-daily-practices.js`: Basic test for daily practices table operations
   - `test-daily-practices-enhanced.js`: Comprehensive test with add/remove operations
   - `test-daily-practices-verification.js`: Final verification with real-world scenarios

2. **Manual Testing Steps**
   - Add a practice to daily list and refresh page - confirm it persists
   - Remove a practice from daily list and refresh - confirm it's removed
   - Key practices (Cold Shower, Gratitude Journal, Focus Breathing) should remain daily

## üöÄ Running the Tests

```bash
# Set up environment first
cp .env.example .env
# Edit with your Supabase credentials and test user ID

# Run tests
npm run test-daily          # Basic test
npm run test-daily-enhanced # Enhanced test
npm run verify-daily        # Verification script
```

## üìö Documentation

1. **Developer Documentation**
   - `DAILY-PRACTICES-GUIDE.md`: Comprehensive guide to daily practices implementation

2. **Code Comments**
   - Enhanced logging and comments throughout the codebase
   - Clear explanations of persistence strategy

## üõ°Ô∏è Resilience Features

1. **Multi-Layer Persistence**
   - Primary: Database (`user_daily_practices` table)
   - Backup: In-memory state with isDaily flag
   - Fallback: localStorage with isDaily flag

2. **Auto-Recovery**
   - Key practices auto-added to daily list if missing
   - Database sync on each page load

3. **Error Handling**
   - Continues functioning even if database operations fail
   - Detailed error logging for debugging

## ‚öôÔ∏è Database Schema

**user_daily_practices table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_daily_practices (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  practice_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  added_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, practice_id)
);
```

This implementation ensures reliable persistence of daily practices across sessions, providing a smooth user experience with proper feedback.
