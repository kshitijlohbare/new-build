# CORS and 400 Bad Request Error Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve CORS issues with Lottie animations and 400 Bad Request errors when fetching suggested users.

## 1. CORS Error Fix for Lottie Animations

### Problem
The application was attempting to load Lottie animations from `lottie.host`, which resulted in CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors because the remote server wasn't configured to allow requests from our domain.

### Solution
1. Created local copies of the Lottie animations in `src/assets/lottie-animations.ts`
2. Modified `DailyPracticesSimple.tsx` to import animations from the local file instead of fetching them from lottie.host
3. Added better error handling and debugging for animation loading

### Implementation Details
- Local animations are defined in TypeScript with proper typing
- The component now logs success/failure when loading animations
- The component gracefully handles failed animation loads

## 2. 400 Bad Request Error Fix for Suggested Users

### Problem
The application had two separate issues with the suggested users feature:

1. First issue: The query was generating invalid SQL when there were no following IDs to exclude, resulting in a malformed query like `.not('id', 'in', '()')` which caused 400 Bad Request errors.

2. Second issue: The query was trying to order by `followers_count` column which doesn't exist in the `user_profiles` table, resulting in SQL errors with message: "column user_profiles.followers_count does not exist".

### Solution
1. Modified the query construction to avoid SQL syntax errors with empty arrays:
   - Added a conditional check for empty followingIds array
   - Used `.neq('id', user.id)` as a fallback when there are no other IDs to exclude

2. Removed the problematic ordering by the non-existent column:
   - Removed `.order('followers_count', { ascending: false })` 
   - Increased the limit to fetch more users to compensate for lack of sorting
   - Created script to add the missing column for future use

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// The error shows that 'followers_count' doesn't exist as a column
// Let's query without trying to order by that non-existent column
let query = supabase
  .from('user_profiles')
  .select('*')
  .limit(10);  // Get more results since we can't sort by popularity

// Only apply the "not in" filter if there are IDs to exclude
if (followingIds.length > 0) {
  query = query.not('id', 'in', `(${followingIds.join(',')})`);
} else {
  // If no IDs to exclude, just exclude the current user
  query = query.neq('id', user.id);
}
```

### Database Enhancement
Created a script `add-followers-count-column.js` that:
1. Adds the missing `followers_count` column to the `user_profiles` table
2. Creates a trigger to automatically update this count when users follow/unfollow
3. Initializes the count based on existing data

## Testing
- Ensure that the Lottie animation appears properly when completing a practice
- Verify that the Suggested Users section loads without errors
- Check the browser console for any remaining errors related to these issues

## Debugging
Additional logging has been added to both issues to help diagnose any future problems:
- Animation loading success/failure is now logged
- Request details for suggested users queries are logged on error
