  {
    term: "Specific Knowledge",
    story: "Despite having no formal degree, Jamie developed such deep expertise in blockchain technology through years of personal interest that companies eventually competed to hire her as a specialized consultant.",
    explanation: "Specific Knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. It's found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than what is hot or fashionable. It's often highly technical or creative and cannot be outsourced or automated.",

  {
    term: "Leverage",
    story: "Monica spent three months building an app that automated a routine task. While her colleagues continued spending 10 hours weekly on this task, her solution worked for her while she slept, giving her more time to develop other valuable skills.",
    explanation: "Leverage amplifies your effort without requiring your presence or time. Code, media, capital, and labor are forms of leverage that can work for you in your absence, creating true wealth beyond trading time for money.",
    category: "Naval Philosophy",

  },
  {
    term: "Play Long-term Games",
    story: "Instead of jumping between companies for small raises, Daniel spent five years becoming invaluable at one company, building deep relationships and specialized knowledge that eventually allowed him to negotiate ownership and significantly higher compensation.",
    explanation: "Long-term games with long-term people build compound interest in reputation, knowledge, and resources. Consistent small actions over time create exponential returns that short-term strategies cannot match.",
    category: "Naval Philosophy",

  },
  {
    term: "Foundational Knowledge",
    story: "Rather than memorizing mathematical formulas, Lisa focused on deeply understanding core mathematical principles. This approach enabled her to solve novel problems others found impossible, as she could derive solutions from first principles.",
    explanation: "Foundational knowledge includes understanding the core principles that don't change. Learning the fundamentals deeply rather than chasing trends allows you to adapt to any situation because you understand why things work.",
    category: "Naval Philosophy",

  },
  {
    term: "Happiness as a Choice",
    story: "After achieving significant external success but still feeling dissatisfied, Raj began practicing mindfulness and acceptance. He realized his unhappiness stemmed from constant desire rather than his circumstances.",
    explanation: "Happiness is not about external achievements but about peace in the present moment. It's largely a choice—a skill that can be developed through practices like mindfulness, gratitude, and releasing desires and attachments.",

  },
  {
    term: "Working With the Leverage of Technology",
    story: "Instead of selling her designs one-by-one as a freelancer, Sofia created a digital template store. After the initial work creating high-quality templates, she earned passive income as thousands of customers purchased copies with no additional effort from her.",
    explanation: "Technology and code create leverage by allowing your work to scale infinitely at near-zero marginal cost. One person with technology leverage can now accomplish what previously required hundreds of people.",

  },
  {
    term: "Reading as Compound Interest",
    story: "While others watched TV in the evenings, Amir read for an hour daily. After ten years, his knowledge had compounded to make him an invaluable problem solver, earning him opportunities that amazed those who hadn't invested in continuous learning.",
    explanation: "Reading is the most efficient way to acquire knowledge from those who spent lifetimes gaining it. Like compound interest in finance, consistent reading creates an exponential knowledge advantage over time.",

  {
    term: "Truth Over Social Approval",
    story: "In a meeting where everyone nodded agreement to an unrealistic plan, Maya pointed out critical flaws despite knowing her honesty might be unpopular. This initially created tension but ultimately saved the project from failure.",
    explanation: "Seeking truth rather than social approval leads to better decisions and authentic relationships. Those who speak honestly attract others who value truth, creating environments where real problems can be solved.",
    category: "Naval Philosophy",
    icon: "naval",
  },
  {
    term: "Permissionless Leverage",
    story: "When Dario's creative ideas were repeatedly rejected by his employer, he started sharing them on social media instead. His insights gained thousands of followers, eventually attracting clients who valued exactly what his employer had dismissed.",
    explanation: "Modern leverage like coding, writing, or building an audience doesn't require anyone's permission or approval. Unlike traditional forms of leverage (labor, capital), these tools are increasingly accessible to everyone.",

    icon: "naval",
  },
  {
    term: "Inversion",
    story: "Instead of listing all the things she needed to succeed, Leila wrote down everything that would guarantee her failure—then focused on avoiding those behaviors and situations.",
    explanation: "Inversion means approaching problems backward. Often, avoiding obvious mistakes and removing obstacles leads to better outcomes than pursuing ever more optimization of what seems to be working.",
