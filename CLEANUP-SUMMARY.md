# Cactus Coco Project Cleanup Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Community Feature Removal
- Removed Community route from App.tsx
- Removed all Community-related components and UI:
  - Community.tsx page
  - CommunityDelights, CommunityPractices, CommunityTips components
  - Various card components (DelightCard, PracticeCard, etc.)
- Removed community functionality from ShareDelights.tsx
- Simplified DummyDataLoader.tsx to a no-op component

### 2. TypeScript Errors Fixed
- Fixed function signatures in profileUtils.ts:
  - Updated ensureUserProfile to properly return profile data
  - Modified isFollowing function to accept proper parameters
  - Resolved unused variable warnings
- Added placeholder exports to community-related files to maintain type compatibility

### 3. Meditation Page Enhanced
- Added dynamic size changes for breathing circle (1x → 1.3x → 1x)
- Added circular progress indicator for each phase
- Added two dotted guide circles (1x and 1.2x radius)
- Improved animations for inhale, hold, and exhale phases

### 4. Project Cleanup
- Updated clean-project.sh script to remove unnecessary files:
  - Test scripts
  - Documentation files
  - SQL migration scripts
  - Community-related components and assets
  - Unused utility scripts

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Implemented code splitting in vite.config.js to reduce bundle size:
  - Split vendor dependencies into separate chunks (React, UI libraries, charts)
  - Split application code by feature (auth, meditation, practices)
  - Increased chunk size warning limit to accommodate larger modules

## Files Ready for Removal

The following files are now safe to remove as they are no longer referenced:

```
src/pages/Community.tsx
src/pages/TherapistListingEnhanced.tsx
src/scripts/checkCommunityDelights.ts
src/scripts/communityDummyData.ts
src/components/ui/DummyDataLoader.tsx
src/components/community/* (all files)
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Further optimize assets (images, SVGs, fonts)
   - Consider implementing lazy loading for non-critical components

2. **Code Quality**
   - Add more comprehensive TypeScript types
   - Consider adding unit tests for critical components

3. **User Experience**
   - Further enhance the Meditation page animations
   - Optimize mobile responsiveness
