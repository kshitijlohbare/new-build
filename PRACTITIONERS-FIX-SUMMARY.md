# Practitioner Visibility Fix Summary

## Status: RESOLVED âœ…

The practitioner visibility issue has been thoroughly investigated and is confirmed to be working correctly. Anonymous users can successfully access practitioner data.

## Investigation Process

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Examined database schema and RLS policies
   - Created check scripts to verify access
   - Identified potential API key inconsistencies

2. **Fix Development**
   - Created comprehensive fix scripts that would:
     - Check if the practitioners table exists
     - Verify if there's data in the table
     - Check if RLS is enabled
     - Add an RLS policy for anonymous read access if needed
   
3. **Testing & Verification**
   - Ran verification scripts that confirmed practitioners are visible
   - Found and fixed API key inconsistencies across the codebase
   - Documented the solution for future reference

## Solution Components

### Verification Scripts
- `final-practitioners-check.js` - Simple script to verify access
- `verify-practitioners-access.js` - More detailed verification
- `check_rls.js` - Checks RLS configuration

### Fix Scripts (Created but not needed)
- `fix-practitioners-visibility.js` - JavaScript solution
- `fix-rls-policies.sql` - SQL-only solution
- `execute-practitioner-fix.js` - Master script

### Utility Scripts
- `standardize-api-keys.js` - Finds and fixes API key inconsistencies

## API Key Issue

We found and fixed API key inconsistencies in:
- `check_rls.mjs`
- `check_rls.js`
- `src/lib/supabase.ts`

The issue was that some files were using a key with a different `ref` claim:
- Incorrect: `svnczxevigicuskpiyfz` (missing a 'p')
- Correct: `svnczxevigicuskppyfz`

## Current State

The practitioners table is:
- Accessible to anonymous users
- Contains data for multiple practitioners
- Properly configured for public access

## Test Results

```
Final check for practitioners visibility:
Found 5 practitioners!
Sample data:
1. Dr. Sarah Johnson - Clinical Psychologist specializing in anxiety disorders
2. Dr. Michael Chen - Psychiatrist focusing on depression and mood disorders
3. Emily Rodriguez, LCSW - Licensed Clinical Social Worker with ADHD expertise
4. Dr. Robert Taylor - Marriage counselor and family therapist
5. Jennifer Wu, LPC - Licensed Professional Counselor specializing in OCD

ACCESS CHECK: PASSED
Anonymous users can access practitioner data successfully.

- Comments within each script file

## Recommendations

1. Always test anonymous access after setting up new public-facing tables
2. Use consistent API keys across all development files
3. Include proper RLS policies in initial table setup scripts
4. Use the provided verification scripts periodically to ensure continued access
